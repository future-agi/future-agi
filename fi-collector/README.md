# fi-collector

The FutureAGI OpenTelemetry Collector — production write path for the new
ClickHouse 25.3 spans store. Replaces the entire
`SDK → Django OTLP → Redis → Celery → PG → PeerDB → CH 24.10 → spans_mv` chain
mandated to die by `PLAN_V2_NO_CDC.md`.

```
Customer SDK (OTLP / HTTP / gRPC)
    → fi-collector  (this binary)
       • OTLP receiver
       • memory_limiter (backpressure)
       • batch processor (10K spans / 5s)
       • clickhouse25 exporter — splits OTel attrs into typed Maps + typed JSON,
                                 writes via clickhouse-go native protocol
    → ClickHouse 25.3 spans table
```

No PG. No Redis buffer. No CDC. No `spans_mv`. The typed-Map split that used
to run inside CH (and caused the OOMs) now runs in this Go binary at ingest
time, with bounded per-batch memory.

## Two run modes

### 1. Bundled with the FutureAGI backend (single docker compose up)

The main `docker-compose.yml` at `future-agi/` adds `fi-collector` as a
service alongside Django, Postgres, ClickHouse, etc. One `docker compose up`
brings everything live; SDKs point at the collector instead of Django's
`/v1/traces` endpoint.

### 2. Standalone (just collector + ClickHouse)

```bash
cd fi-collector/
docker compose -f docker-compose.standalone.yml up
# SDKs → http://localhost:4317 (gRPC) or http://localhost:4318 (HTTP)
# ClickHouse 25.3 at localhost:18123 (HTTP) / 19000 (native)
```

Use this for testing the collector in isolation, or for deploying it as a
sidecar in a non-FutureAGI environment.

## Why a custom OTel exporter

Off-the-shelf options considered:

- **opentelemetry-collector-contrib's `clickhouseexporter`** — assumes its own
  hardcoded schema (otel_traces / otel_logs / otel_metrics). Doesn't know
  about typed Map columns, materialized hot LLM keys, the v2 schema's
  PROJECTION shapes, or the `attributes_extra` typed JSON overflow tier.
  Would require us to rebuild every dashboard query against its schema.

- **Direct CH writer in Django** — keeps Python in the hot path, which is the
  entire reason for moving off PG-as-write-target. Doesn't scale to 1B/day.

- **Custom Go OTel exporter (this)** — uses the official OTel Collector
  framework (receivers / processors / exporters / queue / retry / batching
  all come for free); custom exporter component does ONE thing: take OTLP
  span pdata and write a row matching `tracer/services/clickhouse/v2/schema/`
  via the official `clickhouse-go/v2` native driver. Same code path SigNoz,
  ClickStack, and Uptrace all use.

## Build / run

Local dev (against a CH 25.3 sidecar running at 127.0.0.1:19001):

```bash
make build               # ocb + go build → bin/fi-collector
make run                 # bin/fi-collector --config config/fi-collector-local.yaml
make test                # unit tests
make bench               # benchmark adapter + writer
```

For OCB (the OTel Collector builder): the Makefile installs it if missing.

## Pricing Configuration

### FI_PRICING_JSON

Optional path to a litellm `model_prices_and_context_window.json` file. When set, the
collector uses the file at this path to price token-based cost; when empty or unset, the
collector falls back to an embedded snapshot of the litellm pricing table (current at build time).
If the file at this path can't be read or parsed, the collector logs an error and falls back to
the embedded snapshot rather than disabling token-based pricing.

Use this to refresh pricing without rebuilding the collector:

```bash
# Mount a newer pricing file (e.g., from a ConfigMap or shared volume)
FI_PRICING_JSON=/etc/fi-collector/model_prices.json ./bin/fi-collector --config config/fi-collector-prod.yaml
```

Refresh the embedded snapshot by re-vendoring `fi-collector/pkg/pricing/model_prices.json` at build
time (this is a compile-time `//go:embed`):

```bash
# Inside the repo
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BerriAI/litellm/main/model_prices_and_context_window.json \
  -o fi-collector/pkg/pricing/model_prices.json
make build
```

**Note:** Token-based cost computation also includes a per-organization fallback (`CustomAIModel`)
for models not in the litellm table. Custom model pricing is stored in the Django Postgres database
(scoped by organization); the collector reads it on-demand and caches for 24 hours. When neither
the litellm table nor custom pricing applies, the span's cost is 0.

## Operational backpressure model

```
SDK   ──HTTP/gRPC──►   fi-collector
                        ├─ OTLP receiver       (atomic admission control)
                        ├─ queue_limiter       (bounded requests, rows, & bytes capacity)
                        ├─ batch flusher       (5K spans / 5s, whichever first)
                        ├─ canonical writer    (ClickHouse insert + dead-letter fsync fallback)
                        └─ durable ack         (HTTP 200 / gRPC OK returned only after CH or dead-letter)
                                ▼
                        ClickHouse 25.3
```

- **Bounded capacity**: Queued plus in-flight requests, rows, and bytes are strictly bounded by `queue_max_requests`, `queue_max_rows`, and `queue_max_bytes` (`FI_QUEUE_MAX_*`).
- **Overload backpressure**: When capacity is temporarily full, OTLP requests are rejected with retryable overload errors (HTTP 503 + `Retry-After: 1`, gRPC `Unavailable` + `RetryInfo`).
- **Oversized rejection**: Requests that exceed maximum queue limits are rejected atomically with non-retryable errors (HTTP 413, gRPC `ResourceExhausted`).
- **Durable acknowledgement**: OTLP responses are acknowledged only after ClickHouse accepts the batch or the batch is durably written to `dead_letter.jsonl`. Failure of both returns a retryable error.

## Migration relationship

- This component is the **steady-state writer**. After it's deployed, the
  old `bulk_create_observation_span_task` (Celery), `PayloadStorage`
  (Redis buffer), the PG `tracer_observation_span` table, all PeerDB infra,
  the CH 24.10 `spans_mv`, and the entire `docker-compose.peerdb.yml`
  CAN be deleted (per `PLAN_V2_NO_CDC.md` §4–5).
- The **historical backfill** (one-shot, Python, lives in `planning/.../migration/scripts/`)
  populates the new CH cluster with everything PG was holding at cutover
  time. After this collector is live, new spans flow direct, and the
  historical-data tooling is archived.

## Status

This is the scaffolding + adapter + writer + exporter component, with
tests. Production readiness needs:

- Real load test (10K+ spans/sec sustained against a real CH cluster)
- Integration with the main `docker-compose.yml`
- Monitoring/metrics exporter for ops visibility
